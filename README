Ever get somewhere and then forget why you came?

Popup Places aims to solve that problem for you.
In Popup Places you select a location from a map, and tell it what you want to be reminded of when you get there.

The next time you arrive at that Place, up Pop's your reminder!

Popup Places is an Android Application utilizing Google Maps and Android's Location Services.
